In this world were it becomes hard to distinguish between real and generated images we have created a Tinder App where people can vote on whether the image is real or generated by an AI.

Welcome to our Tinder Streamlit App! 
This app is a web application built with Streamlit, a Python library for building web applications. It provides a simple and interactive way to explore and interact with images.
